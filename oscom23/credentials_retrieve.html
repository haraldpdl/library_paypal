<h1 class="notoc">Retrieve API Credentials<br /><small>PayPal: Retrieve Credentials</small></h1>

<p>Retrieving the store owners PayPal account API Credentials allows the App to configure itself with the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>API Username</li>
  <li>API Password</li>
  <li>API Signature</li>
  <li>PayPal E-Mail Address</li>
</ul>

<p>The API Credentials are used to securely communicate with PayPal and perform transactions with.</p>

<p>Retrieving the API Credentials can be performed for existing PayPal accounts and for new accounts. If the store owner does not yet have a PayPal account, a Sandbox account for testing can be created at no charge to test the App and PayPal payment methods with.</p>

<p>The process of retrieving the API Credentials is performed securely and seamlessly where the store owner is directed to PayPal to authorize the App to be able to retrieve their API Credentials and is returned to the App for the retrieval and configuration to take place. The exact process of this flow is described in the Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Using either <i>Retrieve Live Credentials</i> or <i>Retrieve Sandbox Credentials</i> buttons directs the store owner to PayPal to begin the procedure.</p>
