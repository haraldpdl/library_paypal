<h3 class="notoc">Online Updates</h3>

<p>The PayPal App automatically checks once every 24 hours if an update for the App is available. This check is only performed while using the App and a real-time check is always performed on the <span class="label label-default">Info/Help</span> page.</p>

<p>The following notification is shown throughout the App if a new version is available:</p>

<p>Details of the new version can be viewed by using the <span class="label label-success">View Update</span> button.</p>

<p>The changelog of each update is shown which describes the changes that went into that update release.</p>

<p>The update can be performed automatically by using the <span class="label label-success">Apply Update</span> button. This will download the update, verify the package contents, confirm that the changes can be applied, and will then perform the update. If more than one update is available, the first update will be applied and will automatically continue to the next update in sequential order until all updates have been applied.</p>

<div class="note">Online updates that are applied will automatically update and overwrite files that have been updated. This will only be performed on files belonging to the App and will not touch other files in your store installation directory.</div>
