  <li>SSL Certificate verified transactions</li>

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>SSL Certificate Verified Transactions</h3>

<p>All secured API transaction calls sent to PayPal are performed by verifying PayPal's SSL certificates to guarantee the identity of PayPal. This is performed by using the following public keys in order if they are available:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ext/modules/payment/paypal/paypal.com.crt</li>
  <li>includes/cacert.pem (public key bundle)</li>
  <li>the web server configured public key bundle</li>
</ul>

<p>A test connection link is available on the payment module configuration page which can be used to test if API transaction calls to PayPal can be verified from your web server. If the test connection fails, please contact your hosting provider as they may need to update your web server configuration. The SSL certificate verification can also be disabled on the payment module configuration page however it is highly discouraged to disable.</p>

<div class="alert">Some web hosting providers require a curl proxy to be used which can be configured on the payment module configuration page.</div>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<h3>Line Items</h3>

<p>Each product that is ordered is passed on to PayPal as line items to tie to the transaction. This includes extra third-party Order Total modules that manipulate the order total values (eg, discounts). In rare occassions, when the line items, shipping, and tax calculations do not match the order total value, only the order total value is passed onto PayPal without the line items.</p>

<h2>Add-On Package</h2>

<p>The separate PayPal Payments Pro (Payflow Edition) Add-On package is available at:</p>

<p><a href="http://addons.oscommerce.com/info/5660" target="_blank">http://addons.oscommerce.com/info/5660</a></p>

<h2>Manual Installation (as an Add-On)</h2>

<p>After extracting the Add-On package, copy the files located in the <em>catalog</em> directory to your osCommerce installation directory on the server. The files must be copied in the correct directory structure as extracted from the Add-On package.</p>

<p>The file listing is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ext/modules/payment/paypal/paypal.com.crt</li>
  <li>includes/languages/english/modules/payment/paypal_pro_payflow_dp.php</li>
  <li>includes/modules/payment/paypal_pro_payflow_dp.php</li>
</ul>

<p>The standard language definitions in English are provided in the Add-On package. For additional languages, copy the English language definition file to the appropriate language directory and open the file with a text editor to edit the language definitions. The location of the language definition file must be in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>includes/languages/<em>LANGUAGE</em>/modules/payment/paypal_pro_payflow_dp.php</li>
</ul>

<p>When the files have been copied to their appropriate locations, the payment module will be available on the Administration Tool -> Modules -> Payment -> Install Module page where it can be installed, or on the Administration Tool -> Modules -> Payment page if the module was already previously installed.</p>

<p>If the module was already previously installed, it is important to visit the module configuration page to make sure new parameters are automatically installed in the database.</p>
