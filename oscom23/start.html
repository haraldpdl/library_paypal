This is presented with the following page:</p>

<p>The <span class="label label-info">Retrieve API Credentials</span> buttons allows the App to retrieve the API Credentials of existing and new PayPal accounts to automatically configure itself with.</p>

<p>New PayPal sellers are able to test the PayPal App with a PayPal Sandbox account at no charge, and can create and retrieve their Live account credentials to start accepting PayPal payments when ready.</p>

<p>As soon as the API Credentials have been configured, the App automatically adds more links to the navigation menu box to start using the App.</p>

<p>If the online store has already been configured previously with the official PayPal modules bundled in the osCommerce Online Merchant releases, the App will automatically migrate the previous module configuration parameters and configure itself with the configuration values.</p>
