<h3 class="notoc">Log In with PayPal <small>PayPal: Configure &rarr; Log In</small></h3>

<p>Log In with PayPal allows guests to authenticate themselves through PayPal and to securely share their personal and shipping address information without the need to create a customer account on your store. The shared information is used to calculate taxes and to retrieve a list of available shipping rates for their order based on their shipping address.</p>

<p>When guests authenticate themselves through PayPal, their default payment method is automatically set to PayPal Express Checkout which they can use without needing to sign into again.</p>

<h4 class="notoc">Features</h4>

<h5 class="notoc">Seamless Checkout</h5>

<p>Seamless Checkout requires the <a href="{link}Package|Library|en&paypal&oscom23&express_checkout{link}">PayPal Express Checkout</a> module to be enabled and allows customers who have logged in through PayPal to proceed straight to the Express Checkout flow without needing to log in again.</p>

<h4 class="notoc">Requirements</h4>

<p>Log In with PayPal requires the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PayPal REST App; a PayPal REST App needs to be created at the <a href="https://developer.paypal.com" target="_blank">PayPal Developer</a> site. The Client ID and Secret API credentials assigned to the application need to be entered in the module configuration page.</li>
  <li>The Return URL displayed in the module configuration page needs to be entered as the Return URL in the PayPal REST App created for Log In with PayPal.</li>
  <li>Content Modules; as Log In with PayPal is a content module, it requires the Content Modules implementation introduced in osCommerce Online Merchant v2.3.4. Please refer to its <a href="{link}Online|Library|en&oscom_2_3&release_notes&v2_3_4{link}">release notes</a> to add the implementation into your existing store.</li>
  <li>Set Password Content Module; it is important to enable the Set Password content module to automatically replace the My Account -> Change Password link to a Set Password link.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="notoc">Notes</h4>

<h5 class="notoc">Customer Accounts</h5>

<p>Log In with PayPal allows guest purchases to be made without the customer needing to create or log into their local store account. As a customer account is needed to track orders, when the customer returns back to the store after logging in through PayPal, either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they are automatically logged into their store account matching the same e-mail address, or</li>
  <li>a store account based on their PayPal e-mail address is automatically created with an empty password</li>
</ul>

<p>Customers cannot log into automatically created store accounts until they set a password on the My Account -> Set Password page, and can continue to log in through PayPal until a password has been set.</p>

<div class="note">Please note that the sharing of customer email addresses does not authorize your business to email consumers. For any communications not related to a purchase (such as marketing emails, newsletters, and offers), you must continue to present your customers with separate opt-in/out options.</div>
