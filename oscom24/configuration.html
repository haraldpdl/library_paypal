  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>PayPal Express Checkout</li>
      <li>PayPal Payments Pro (Direct Payments)</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>Transactions Order Status</dt>
  <dd>This is the Order Status level where the result of API transactions are stored. This Order Status level should be private and should not be visible to customers when they view their order information.</dd>

  <dt>Log Transactions</dt>
  <dd>The request and response values of each API transaction call can be logged to identify and help find a solution to any problem. It is recommended to log all API calls when beginning to use the App and to change it to log only errors when all App features have been tested.</dd>
