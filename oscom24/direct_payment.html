<h4 class="notoc">Notes</h4>

<h5 class="notoc">Line Items</h5>

<p>Each product that is ordered is passed on to PayPal as line items to link to the transaction. This includes extra third-party Order Total modules that manipulate the order total values (eg, discounts). In rare occassions, when the line items, shipping, and tax calculations do not match the order total value, only the order total value is passed onto PayPal without the line items.</p>
