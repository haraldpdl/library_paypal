<h1>PayPal Payments Pro (UK) Direct Payments<br /><small>for osCommerce Online Merchant v2.3</small></h1>

<p>PayPal Payments Pro (UK) Direct Payments allows Debit/Credit cards to be accepted directly on a merchant's website during the checkout process.</p>

<p>PayPal Payments Pro (UK) Direct Payments is included in osCommerce Online Merchant v2.2 and is available as a separate add-on for existing store owners who are running earlier versions.</p>

<p>The PayPal Payments Pro (UK) Direct Payments payment module supports the following PayPal features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sandbox server to perform test transactions</li>
  <li>Authorization and Sale transaction methods</li>
  <li>Process credit and debit cards directly during the checkout procedure</li>
</ul>

<div class="alert">This payment module is targeted at UK PayPal merchants and uses the Payflow payment gateway. PayPal requires the Payments Pro (UK) Express Checkout payment module to be enabled if this module is activated and therefore should not be used as a stand alone product.</div>

<div class="alert">This payment module requires PHP to support cURL or access to the "curl" program file.</div>
